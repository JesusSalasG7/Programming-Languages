(* interpreter for our language: 
   * takes a geometry expression and returns a geometry value
   * for simplicity we have the top-level function take an environment,
     (which should be [] for the whole program
   * we assume the expression e has already been "preprocessed" as described
     in the assignment: 
         * line segments are not actually points (endpoints not real close)
         * lines segment have left (or, if vertical, bottom) coordinate first
